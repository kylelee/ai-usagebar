# Configuration reference

The config file is `~/.config/ai-usagebar-omarchy/config.toml` (mode 0600).
All fields are optional. Keys are configured inline — `api_key = "…"`
directly in the section — no environment variables needed (an optional
`api_key_env` per section still lets one override the inline value).
Claude, Codex, Z.AI, and OpenRouter are enabled by default; other providers are
opt-in. The commented example shows the defaults and provider-specific
settings.

```toml

```

For more than one OpenRouter key, see the
[OpenRouter account guide](openrouter-accounts.md). The existing singular
`[openrouter]` key remains the default account and needs no migration.

For more than one Codex login, add `[[openai.accounts]]` — a label and that
login's own `auth.json`, the same shape `[[anthropic.accounts]]` uses:

```toml
[[openai.accounts]]
label = "work"
codex_auth_path = "~/.config/ai-usagebar-omarchy/accounts/work-codex/auth.json"
```

Create the second login with `CODEX_HOME=~/.codex-work codex login` and point
`codex_auth_path` at the file it writes. Select it with `--account work`; each
account caches separately under `~/.cache/ai-usagebar-omarchy/openai/<label>`. The
singular `codex_auth_path` remains the default account and needs no migration.

## Z.AI / BigModel account types

Each Z.AI key — the singular `[zai]` section or any `[[zai.accounts]]` entry —
is billed one of three ways, and `account_type` says which:

- `personal` (default): a personal coding-plan subscription. Queried on
  `api.z.ai` (or `site = "cn"` for a bigmodel.cn personal key).
- `team`: an enterprise/team coding-plan key. The team plan only exists on the
  BigModel China site, so these keys query `open.bigmodel.cn` with `?type=2`
  plus the `bigmodel-organization` / `bigmodel-project` headers. Both ids are
  required — get them from the bigmodel.cn console (F12 → Application → Local
  Storage → `Bigmodel-Organization` / `Bigmodel-Project`). The response shape
  is identical to the personal plan.
- `usage`: a pay-as-you-go key with no coding subscription. The quota endpoint
  answers "not subscribed" for it, so ai-usagebar-omarchy skips quota and reports the
  7-day aggregate (prompts · tokens) from the model-usage endpoint instead.

```toml
[[zai.accounts]]
account_type = "team"
organization_id = "org-…"
project_id = "proj-…"

[[zai.accounts]]
account_type = "usage"
```

Accounts carry no `label`: each is auto-named by its POSITION in the list
("1", "2", … — the order the settings panel shows), which doubles as the
`--account 2` selector; caches are isolated per account under
`~/.cache/ai-usagebar-omarchy/zai/<n>`. The site (z.ai / bigmodel.cn) is
auto-detected from the account type — team & usage keys query
bigmodel.cn, personal keys z.ai — so no `site` is needed.

**Every key-based vendor takes the same multi-account shape** — Z.AI,
Kimi, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Kilo, Novita, Moonshot, Grok, MiniMax,
OpenCode Go, Anthropic API and OpenAI API:

```toml
[[deepseek.accounts]]
api_key = "paste-another-key"

[[anthropic_api.accounts]]
api_key = "paste-another-admin-key"
monthly_limit = 500      # per-account spend ceiling (spend vendors only)
```

`show_default_account = false` under a section hides its default key's
tab once numbered accounts exist. The settings panel manages all of them
as grouped cards with a per-vendor **Add … Account** button; OpenRouter's
legacy hand-written labels are ignored (positional naming owns it now).

## Seeing every account at once

Two ways to tile all accounts in one bar, the way the old GNOME panel did:

- Omarchy Quattro panel: on by default — every working account appears side
  by side, each tile led by its provider logo (`claude 42% 5.3h │ kimi 18% 1d`);
  there is no module icon in front of the tiles. Toggle **Tile every account
  in the top bar** off for the opposite minimalism: the robot icon alone,
  with the numbers one hover or click away.
- Waybar: run the widget with `--vendor all` for the same tiling, with a
  combined hover tooltip covering every account.
